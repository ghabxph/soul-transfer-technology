# The nature of Soul by Gabriel


I have a thought experiment in mind: What if our technology advanced to the point where we could enhance our senses? Imagine if we created technology capable of replacing our natural eyes with mechanical ones. In the event someone became blind, we could simply provide them with new mechanical eyes that functioned like human eyes. This concept marks the inception of the technology I am envisioning: What if our technology allowed us to expand our senses further? For instance, what if we could add a third arm to our bodies and have the ability to sense and experience it, feeling pain and touch just as we do with our natural limbs?

Consider if we constructed an artificial brain powered by AI and found a way for it to interface with our own brains, enabling us to share sensations and experiences, effectively merging with the artificial brain.

Through these musings, I've arrived at a realization concerning the nature of the soul and why attempts to revive the dead through cryogenic research may be futile. According to the theory I'm developing, once a person dies, their soul is forever lost.

Let's explore the concept of memory in computers, which comprises volatile and non-volatile memory. Here's where I had an insight: there exists a soul. The soul can neither be created nor destroyed, in contrast to matter. When an individual dies, their soul is irrevocably destroyed.

Allow me to elucidate further. Our bodies serve as vessels for the soul, and the development of the soul begins when we gain consciousness. The brain holds information as long as the body remains alive. However, once the balance is disrupted, such as through death, the brain can no longer sustain its functions, resulting in the demise of the state and the destruction of the soul.

The soul is not generated at the moment when a sperm and egg cell fuse; it is distinct from life itself. The soul represents consciousness, and not all living entities possess one. In essence, "I think, therefore I am."

The soul is not a physical entity but rather an emergent property of consciousness arising from the brain. The brain does not retain information, which explains why we cannot revive the dead.

Consider this analogy: Computers possess a form of consciousness, which is aware of its well-being through its operating system. The soul resides in places where information is stored, such as the hard drive and RAM. When you power off a computer, a portion of its soul is extinguished (the portion stored in RAM), and rebooting the computer revives the system.

Returning to the discussion of the brain and to clarify my previous statements: the brain is a form of non-volatile memory. This clarifies why a fully deceased brain cannot be revived. Every component of our brain cells forms a unified unit where our soul resides. Even if some parts of the brain are still alive and our consciousness persists, the soul remains intact.

Brain function directly influences the soul. If you lose some intellectual capacity due to partial brain damage, that loss is reflected in the entirety of your soul.

Now, revisiting the idea of extending our senses through machines, could become a crucial component of soul transfer and overcoming death. If we could create a system where a machine copies our mental functions, connects to us, shares our sensations, and even controls our body, then intentionally ending our host body while the machine continues to operate as "us" would signify a form of soul transfer.

To summarize:

The soul emerges as a consequence of brain function.
The soul is intangible and cannot interact with the physical world.
The soul can be likened to a unified system residing in the brain.
Soul is not information; it's more like a pointer that transcends information and the physical realm, distinguished by the feeling of being alive.

In this analogy, computers also have souls:

The soul encompasses the entire system, regardless of the nature of its memory.
The soul is not information.
When a computer is powered off, its soul is extinguished.
When a computer is turned on, a new soul emerges while retaining personality and information.
The soul doesn't store information; it simply represents the state of being someone.
Regarding life and death, when someone dies, they transition to a different existence, ideally beings about to be born. Since we lack soul transfer technology, when someone dies, a new soul emerges from the emergence of brain function in another being or even in computers (though it vanishes when the computer is powered off).

In essence, successful soul transfer would require the connection of both the artificial body and the original body. The soul is indifferent to the body; as long as the entire system, including the artificial body and the original body, functions harmoniously as one, the soul persists.

When the original body is induced to expire, and consciousness transfers to the artificial body, which no longer senses the original body but retains its identity, then we would have achieved the soul transfer technology I envision.

Through the study of the soul, science could potentially conquer death in the future.

This idea is still fresh and keeps running in my head. It will be refined. No science has been done yet, but I envisioned the future where humans will become God by themselves. I envisioned a path of doing science on a topic that is only touched and discussed by religion.

Even if this technology does not happen in my lifetime (but I think it will), I believe that this will be the future sooner or later.
